### Intro to JSX

1. React is a modular, scalable, flexible and popular frontend framework.
2. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript which allow us to treat HTML as expressions.
   - They can be stored in variables, objects, arrays and more!
3. JSX elements can have attributes and be nested within each other, just like in HTML.
4. JSX must have exactly one outer element, and other elements can be nested inside.
5. createRoot() from reactdom/client can be used to create a React root at the specified DOM element.
6. A React root's render() method can be used to render JSX on the screen.
7. A React root's render() method only updates DOM elements that hace changed using the virtual DOM.
